# Individual Research Report Code

**Imperial College London MSc Individual Research Report**  
*Conformal Prediction with LDA & QDA Classifiers*

---

This repository contains the full codebase for evaluating and implementing **Conformal Prediction analysis** as part of my MSc Individual Research Report.  
The project explores the performance of **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** and **Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)** classifiers under various data conditions, including synthetic simulations and real RNA-Seq datasets.

## Key Features

- **Synthetic simulation framework:** Generate high-dimensional classification tasks for robust benchmarking.
- **Conformal Prediction (MapieClassifier):** Implementation with multiple scoring rules (Brier, log-loss, spherical).
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** Coverage, sharpness, and probabilistic calibration for LDA/QDA.
- **TCGA Pan-Cancer Pipeline:** RNA-Seq multi-class classification with preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and CP evaluation.

## Data Preparation (TCGA)

1. **Download the data**  
   Head to the Pan-Cancer Atlas page and download all the supplemental data.  
   The provided files have already gone through some preprocessing, such as reducing batch effects.  
   In this project, we primarily use:
   - RNA expression data
   - Copy number data (ABSOLUTE-annotated seg file)
   - Clinical outcome data (CDR)

   You are welcome to download additional modalities if you'd like to experiment further, especially in the data exploration and preprocessing notebooks.

2. **Place the TCGA data** in the appropriate `data/` directory inside the `TCGA-Pancancer/` folder.

3. **Run preprocessing scripts** to prepare the dataset.

4. **Execute notebooks or Python scripts** to train models and evaluate results.
5.
